## LDTS_0307 - Space Shooter
### Grade: 17,3/20
In this game it will be possible to control a spaceship in order to avoid objects that can cause damage to the ship, namely meteors and eliminate enemy ships, each with a certain amount of life and attack damage of its own. To combat them, our ship will be able to obtain certain power-ups over the course of the game, which can range from a temporary (or permanent) increase in attack damage, number of weapons and life, and increased movement speed.
The objective of the game is to get the highest score possible by destroying enemy ships with the help of power-ups, ending when our ship's health reaches zero.
